# Hangman
This is the "Hangman" project for The Odin Project.  This will be a game of hangman played through the command line.  The computer will randomly select an 5 - 12 letter word from the "google-10000-english-no-swears.txt' dictionary which the player will attempt to guess.  The player will have the ability to save the state of their game to a separate file.
